# Network stability agent

No Land measures the real client-to-stream-host path with authenticated UDP probes while keeping all session telemetry in RAM on the gaming instance.

## Components

- `network-agent/`: standalone `noland-network-agent` daemon installed beside Sunshine.
- `src-tauri/src/network_monitor/`: client probe loop, measurement reporter, status event bridge, and three-second disconnect fail-safe.
- `src/app/App.tsx`: OS-native notification and warning sound listener owned by the main window.
- `src/features/moonlight/StreamWindowScreen.tsx`: non-blocking in-stream warning banner only.

The client must originate probes because a gaming instance generally cannot initiate traffic through a user's NAT, CGNAT, or firewall. The client measures RTT with `std::time::Instant`; the instance owns the rolling history, metrics, classification, and BAD-state hysteresis.

Monitoring is observational. Agent installation, UDP, WebSocket, classification, notification, or UI failures do not stop or alter Moonlight streaming.

## WireGuard MTU selection

WireGuard provisioning renders both endpoints with a temporary 1440-byte discovery MTU, establishes and verifies the encrypted tunnel, and only then runs bounded don't-fragment probes to the private server address. A binary search finds the largest reliable four-byte-aligned inner packet, subtracts a 16-byte safety margin, and applies the same selected MTU to the local and remote WireGuard configs. If the selected value differs, the remote interface is updated and the managed local tunnel performs one controlled reconnect. The operational result is capped at 1420 bytes.

Selections are cached for 24 hours per instance and outer network-path fingerprint (destination, source address, and interface). A changed route or interface invalidates the cache. If DNS, route detection, `ping`, ICMP responses, or reliable probing are unavailable, the connected tunnel is rewritten to the fail-safe MTU 1280. Failure to apply the safe value blocks setup instead of leaving an unvalidated discovery MTU active. This provisioning-time PMTU selection is separate from Moonlight's optional in-stream adaptive packet-size controller.

## Network path and ports

The systemd service resolves the IPv4 address assigned to `wg0` and binds only to that address:

- UDP `6201`: 48-byte authenticated probe and ACK packets.
- WebSocket `6202`: session registration, one-second measurement reports, statistics, and status changes.

No public firewall ports are opened. Do not bind these listeners to `0.0.0.0` on rented instances. The initial WebSocket authentication message registers an ephemeral token; it is not proof against an attacker who can already reach the private listener.

## Sampling and retention

- Probe interval: 200 ms (five probes per second).
- Probe timeout: one second.
- Measurement report: once per second, at most 100 samples.
- Classifier window: 30 seconds.
- Statistics window: 60 seconds.
- In-memory retention: five minutes or 1,500 samples per session.
- Warmup: at least five seconds and 25 samples.

The agent calculates current RTT, min/average/median/max, P95/P99, RFC3550-style EWMA jitter, loss percentage, spike ratio, and longest loss burst. A spike is RTT above `median + max(15 ms, jitter × 3)`.

## Classification

Latency quality and stability are calculated separately. Overall status is the worse result.

Default latency thresholds use median RTT:

- `GREAT`: below 30 ms
- `GOOD`: below 60 ms
- `POOR`: below 100 ms
- `BAD`: 100 ms or higher

Default stability boundaries:

| Signal | GREAT | GOOD | POOR | BAD |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Packet loss | ≤0.1% | ≤0.5% | ≤2% | >2% |
| Jitter | ≤3 ms | ≤7 ms | ≤15 ms | >15 ms |
| P95 − median | ≤10 ms | ≤20 ms | ≤40 ms | >40 ms |
| Spike ratio | ≤1% | ≤3% | ≤10% | >10% |

All boundaries are configurable through the `NOLAND_*` environment variables documented by `noland-network-agent --help`.

A candidate `BAD` classification must persist for five seconds before publication and notification. A BAD episode emits one alert. Ten continuous non-BAD seconds are required to publish recovery and re-arm alerting. Separately, the client emits one `CONNECTION_LOST` BAD event after three seconds without any valid ACK, because the server cannot report through a failed path.

## Tauri events

The client emits:

- `network-monitor://stats`: the latest agent `stats_update` payload.
- `network-monitor://status`: agent status changes and client fail-safe transitions.
- `network-monitor://error`: monitor transport or protocol errors.

`network_monitor_get_state` returns the latest in-memory `stats_update` to the frontend. No network history is persisted to disk.

## Remote deployment

Provisioning bundles `network-agent/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `src/**`, builds a release binary on the instance, and installs:

- `/usr/local/bin/noland-network-agent`
- `/usr/local/libexec/noland-network-agent-bind-wg0`
- `/etc/systemd/system/noland-network-agent.service`

The hardened systemd service waits for `wg0`, runs without persistent state, and restarts independently. Provisioning is best-effort and non-blocking for No Land setup. Stream startup also schedules a background ensure operation so instances created by older clients can gain the agent without delaying play.

## Network impairment testing

Run impairment on a dedicated test instance/interface, not a production session. Replace `wg0` if the tested stream uses a different interface.

```sh
# Constant 60 ms delay
sudo tc qdisc replace dev wg0 root netem delay 60ms

# Variable latency
sudo tc qdisc replace dev wg0 root netem delay 20ms 20ms distribution normal

# Three percent packet loss
sudo tc qdisc replace dev wg0 root netem loss 3%

# Delay plus loss
sudo tc qdisc replace dev wg0 root netem delay 80ms 25ms loss 3%

# Remove impairment
sudo tc qdisc del dev wg0 root
```

Validate at minimum:

1. Stable 15 ms classifies GREAT after warmup.
2. Stable 60 ms remains stable but has POOR latency under the strict `<60 ms` boundary.
3. Three percent loss reaches BAD after confirmation.
4. A two-second disturbance does not notify.
5. A BAD episode longer than five seconds notifies once.
6. Ten healthy seconds re-arm alerts.
7. Complete loss triggers the client fail-safe in about three seconds.
